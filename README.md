Aa requested, I did all the following in this exercise:

The website you create should function as a single page app.
You must use HTML and CSS (using pre-compilers such as Sass or LESS is fine).
Your app should support the major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE10+).
We would encourage that you use a framework to speed up development time.
Think about how you might improve the speed of the page in terms of the images/content loading.
Allow the page to have an infinite scroll (loading in more images as you scroll).
A search functionality based on title of the photo.
